# Thief Enhancement Pack


This project is an effort to improve the quality of the graphics in Thief 2: The Metal Age, and also in Thief: The Dark Project and Thief Gold.
The ultimate goal is to replace all the old, low-quality objects and textures from Thief 1 and 2 with versions that have higher polygon counts and texture resolutions, while keeping as close to the originals as possible.


**NewDark (Thief 2 v1.21 or higher) is required**



## Installation
There is no installer, just the ep2.zip file. Drop it into your Thief installation and add it to the mod_path in cam_mod.ini

e.g.:

    mod_path ep2

For Thief 1, instead use:

    mod_path ep2\thief1+ep2



## Things to look out for:
The motto of the EP is "The same, but better".  The textures here should look like the original textures, just less blurry.  If you feel that some are more different than they should be, or are wrongly scaled compared to the originals, please raise an issue about them.



## Want to help?
If you are interested in contributing replacement textures or models, then all faithful replacement textures or models are welcome, but please remember the motto of "the same, but better".
